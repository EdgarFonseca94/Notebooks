# Data Analyst/Science Projects by Edgar Fonseca
-------------------
This is a portfolio where I present my past projects for data analysis and exploration of machine learning algorithms.
## Kaggle Datasets

### Employee Fatigue Prediction

[nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/EdgarFonseca94/Portfolio/blob/main/Employee%20Fatigue/Employee%20Burnout%20Out.ipynb)
- Visualized relationship of fatigue score with independent variables using Seaborn.
- Built machine learning models (Support Vector Regression & Random Forest Regressor) to predict employee fatigue score.
- Utilized RandomizedSearchCV & GridSearchCV to optimize our models.

### Craigslist Apartment Analysis

[EDA nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/EdgarFonseca94/Portfolio/blob/main/Craigslist/Craigslist%20EDA.ipynb)
- Scraped craigslist apartment post using BeatifulSoup & Requests packages
- Cleaned & organized scraped data into a dataframe and saved it to csv format
- Analyzed apartment dataset from the Bay Area to find which areas were more expensive and had the best value
- Built Linear Regression models for each area using square footage and price since square footage had highest correlation with price.
