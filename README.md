### Employee Fatigue Prediction
- Used Machine Learning algorithms (Support Vector Regression & Random Forest Regressor) to predict employee fatigue score.
This project was a regression problem where we attempt to predict a fatigue score for each employee. I made some nice vizulations to explore the relationship between the fatigue score with it's independent variables. I also decided to use two alogorithms (Support Vector Regression & Random Forest Regressor) to build models whic
