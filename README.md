# Data Analyst/Science Projects by Edgar Fonseca
-------------------
This is a portfolio where I present my past projects for data analysis and exploration of machine learning algorithms.
## Kaggle Datasets
------------------
### Employee Fatigue Prediction
- Visualized relationship of fatigue score with independent variables using Seaborn.
- Build machine learning models (Support Vector Regression & Random Forest Regressor) to predict employee fatigue score.
- Utilized RandomizedSearchCV & GridSearchCV to optimize our models.
